# Stock Market Price Prediction using Supervised Learning

### Problem Statement: 

* Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are many factors involved in the stock price prediction ‚Äì general market behavior, company performance, company financial stability, market sentiment and many more. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a good degree of accuracy.

* Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to recognize patterns and insights will be used to make predictions.

### Context:

* Stock market analysis is divided into two parts ‚Äì Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.
¬† ¬† - Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company‚Äôs future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.
¬† ¬† - Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.

* For stock market prediction, we will focus on the historical stock data analysis part. We‚Äôll be using a dataset available from yahoo financial portal. ¬†

### Criteria for success:

For stock market prediction, focus will be on the individual stock historical dataset from yahoo. 

### Scope of solution space: 

* For stock market prediction, roughly 10 years of daily stock close price of a publicly listed company will be used for analysis.

* Predict the future stock price of JPM starting with simple algorithms like linear regression, Polynomial Regression Model and then move on to advanced techniques like ARIMA, Auto ARIMA, LSTM and FB Prophet Model.

### Constraints:

For stock market prediction, focus will be on the historical stock price. Unexpected or unforeseen change in stock prediction due to situations like natural calamities, pandemic, war and or change in government trade policies impact on market sentiments or behavior.

#### Conclusion:

- The graph in the blue color displays the close price history from year 2000 to year 2020. The graph in the red represents the best fit linear equation for the known data. The graph in the green is the future predictions for next two years.

- JPM stock predicted closing price on 2022-12-09 is $99.75

### Polynomial Regression Model:
- Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the independent variable values and the corresponding conditional mean of the dependent variable.

- Let's try a polynomial equation of degree three as a mathematical model. Let's see, how does it perform and what are its predictions. The equation of degree three is ùëì(ùë•) = ùëè‚ÇÄ + ùëè‚ÇÅùë• + ùëè‚ÇÇùë•¬≤ + ùëè‚ÇÉùë•¬≥

#### Conclusion:

- JPM stock predicted closing price on 2022-12-09 is $157.50

- I think, we have moved little bit closer to the reality in terms of fitting the curve.

- Will this be reality? Probably not, let's to look at the techniques like FB prophet, ARIMA or LSTM that specific to time series data predictions.

### Stacked LSTM Model

- The Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM, network is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for sequence problems. In stacked LSTM, ¬†layers are stacked one on top of another into deep recurrent neural networks.

### Conclusion:

- In the LSTM stacked model, we used a 100 day time step to predict 101st day stock price and so on. Error in first day prediction will multiply ¬†for the subsequent days resulting in the overall wrong prediction.¬†
- JPM stock predicted closing price on 2021-01-08 is $131.0.

### FB Prophet Model:
- Prophet is open source software released by Facebook and commonly used procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. It provides us with the ability to make time series predictions with good accuracy using simple intuitive parameters.

#### Conclusion:

- FB Prophet time series forecasting algorithms did not yield dramatically different result.Stock prediction is too complex to be solved by simple techniques.

- JPM predicted closing price on 2022-12-09 is $138.32

### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Model:
* 'Auto Regressive' in ARIMA means it is a linear regression model that uses its own lags as predictors. Linear regression models, as you know, work best when the predictors are not correlated and are independent of each other.

* An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, q where,

- p is the order of the Auto Regressive term
- q is the order of the Moving Average term
- d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary

* Making a series stationary:
- The most common approach is to difference it. That is, subtract the previous value from the current value. Sometimes, depending on the complexity of the series, more than one difference may be needed.

- The value of d, therefore, is the minimum number of differencing needed to make the series stationary. And if the time series is already stationary, then d = 0.

* 'p' and 'q' terms:

- 'p' is the order of the 'Auto Regressive' (AR) term. It refers to the number of lags of Y to be used as predictors.
- 'q' is the order of the 'Moving Average' (MA) term. It refers to the number of lagged forecast errors that should go into the ARIMA Model.

- Check Model is stationary with 1st differencing:

#### The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE): 
- RMSE is a measure frequently used for assessing the accuracy of prediction obtained by a model. It measures the differences or residuals between actual and predicted values. The metric compares prediction errors of different models for a particular data and not between datasets.

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE):¬†
- MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It‚Äôs the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

- The ARIMA and LSTM algorithms that were developed for forecasting the time series are based on rolling forecasting. The rolling forecasting ¬†focuses on a single forecast, i.e., the next data point to predict, for each data set. 

- Comparing all the models, FB Prophet model gave the lowest RMSE of 4.13 and ¬†Mean Absolute Error is: 3.18

- FB Prophet ¬†Model predicted JPM Closing price on 2022-12-09 would be around $138.32
